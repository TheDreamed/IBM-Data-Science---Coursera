What is SQL?
    - A language used for relational databases
    - Query Data

What is Data?
    - Facts(words, numbers)
    - Pictures
    - One of the most critical assets of any business
    - Needs to be secure

What is a Database?
    - A repository of data
    - Provides the functionality for adding, modifying and querying that data.
    - Different kinds of databases store data in different forms.

Relational Database
    - Data stored in tabular form (columns and rows)
    - Columns contain item properties e.g. Last Name, First Name, etc.
    - Table is collection of related things e.g. Employees, Authors, etc.
    - Relationships can exist between tables(hence: "relational)

DBMS
    - Database:  repository of data
    - DBMS: Database Management System - Software to manage databases
    - Database, Database Server, Database System, Data Server, DBMS - often used interchangeably

RDBMS
    -RDBMS: Relational Database Management System
    -Set of software tools that controls data
        -access, organization, and storage.
    - Examples are: MySQL, Oracle Database, IBM Db2, etc.

Basic SQL Commands
    - Create a table
    - Insert
    - Select
    - Update
    - Delete

Retriving rows from a table
    - After creating a table and inserting data into the table, we want to see the data.
    - SELECT statement
        - Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement used to read and modify data.

            Select Statement : Query
            Result from the query : Result set / table

            Select * from <tablename>

Restricting the Result Set : WHERE Clause
    - Restricts the result set
    - Always requires a Predicate:
        - Evaluates to:
        True, False, or Unknown
        -Used in the search condition of the Where clause
    ex. db2 => select book_id, title from Book
                WHERE book_id='B1'

Count
    COUNT() - a built-in function that retrieves the number of rows matching the query criteria.

    Number of rows in a table:
        select COUNT(*) from tablename
ex.
    Rows in the MEDALS table where Country is Canda:
        select COUN(COUNTRY) from MEDALS where COUNTRY='CANADA'
            result: 1/29

Distinct
    DISTINCT is used to remove duplicate values from a result set.

    Retrieve unique values in a column:
        select DISTINCT columnname from tablename
ex.
    List of unique countries that received GOLD Medals:
        select DISTINCT COUNTRY from MEDALS
            where MEDALTYPE = 'GOLD'

Limit
    LIMIT is ued for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the database

        Retrieve just the first 10 rows in a table:
            select * from tablename LIMIT 10

        Retrieve 5 rows in the MEDALS table for a particular year:
            select * from MEDALS where YEAR = 2018 LIMIT 15

Adding rows to a table
    - Create the table(CREATE TABLE statement)
    - Populate table with data:
    - INSERT statement
        - A Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement used to read and modify data

    INSERT INTO [TableName]
        <([ColumnName],...)>
    VALUES([Value],...)

ex.
    Sample Insertion in SQL
        INSERT INTO AUTHOR
            (AUTHOR_ID, LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, EMAIL, CITY, COUNTRY,)
        VALUES('A1', 'Chong', 'Raul', 'rfc@ibm.com', 'Toronto', 'CA')
              ('A1', 'Chong', 'Raul', 'rfc@ibm.com', 'Toronto', 'CA') // Multiple Row insertion

Altering rows of a table - UPDATE statement
    - After creating a table and inserting data into the table, we can alter the data
        - UPDATE statement: A Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement used to read and  modify data

    Update[TableName]
    SET[[ColumnName]=[Value]]
    <WHERE[Condition]>

    UPDATE AUTHOR
    SET LASTNAME = 'KATTA'
        FIRSTNAME = 'LAKSHMI'
        WHERE AUTHOR_ID='A2'

Deleting Rows from a table
    - Remove 1 or more rows from the table:
        - DELETE statement
            - A DML statement used to read and modify data
ex.
    DELETE FROM [TableName]
    <WHERE[CONDITION]>

    DELETE FROM AUTHOR
        Where AUTHOR_ID('A2', 'A3')


How does the syntax of an INSERT statement look?
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ... )
    VALUES (value1, value2, ... )
    ;

How does the syntax of an UPDATE statement look?
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition
    ;

How does the syntax of a DELETE statement look?
    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    ;
