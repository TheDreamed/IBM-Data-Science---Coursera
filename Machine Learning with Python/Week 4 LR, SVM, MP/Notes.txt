    - Predict the probability of a person having a heart attack.
    - Predicting the mortality in injured patients
    - Predicting Purchasing a proudct / halt a subscription
    - Predicting Probability of a given process or product

When is logistic rgeression suitables
    - If your data is binary.
    - If you need probabilistic results.
    - When you need a linear decision boundary.
