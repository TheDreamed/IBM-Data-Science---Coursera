Machine Learning with Python

Use ML to make predictions...

Decision Trees
Use ML to make decisions
Use ML for customer segmentation
Recommendation Systems
Use python libraries to build ML models.

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame.

How Machine learning works

1. Feature Extractions - example: Getting the (Legs, ears, eye size when open and closed, face size etc. of animals)
2. ML models

Example of ML

Recommendation - produce suggestions based on types of shows you watch
Loan Applications - ML used to predict defaults
Telecom - unsubscription prediction based on demographic.

Major machine learning techniques

Regression / Estimation
    -  Predicting continuous values (House price prediction)
Classification
    - Predicting the item class category of a case (Churn classification)
Clustering
    - Finding the structure of data; summarization (Customer segmentation.)
Associations
    - Associating prequent co-occuring items/events (ex. Grocery items that are bought together)
Anomaly Detection
    - Discovering abnormal and unusual cases (Credit card fraud detection)
Sequence Mining
    - Predicting next events; click-stream (Markov Model, HMM)
Dimension Reduction
    - Reducing the size of data (PCA)
Recommendation Systems
    - Recommending items.

Supervised vs Unsupervised Algorithms

What is Supervised Learning?
    -  Teaching the model with labeled data.

Two types of Supervised Learning
    - Classification
        - process of predicting discrete class labels or categories
    - Regression
        - predicting continuous values.

What is UnSupervised Learning?
    Techniques:
        - Dimension Reduction
        - Density Estimation
        - Market Basket Analysis
        - Clustering
What is Clustering
    - Clustering is grouping of data points or objects that are somehow similar by:
        -Discovering structure
        - summarization
        - Anomaly detection

Introduction to Regression

    - process of predicting a continuous value.

Types of Regression

Simple Regression ex. co2 emission vs enginesize
    - Linear
    - Non Linear
Multiple Regression ex. co2emission vs engine and cylinders of cars
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Multiple Non Linear Regression

Applications of Regression

- Sales forecasting
- Satisfaction Analysis
- Price Estimation
- Employment Income

Regression Algorithms

- Ordinal Regression
- Poisson Regression
- Fast Forest Quantile Regression
- Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Stepwise, Ridge Regression
- Bayesian Linear Regression
- Neural Network Regression
- Decision Forest Regression
- Boosted Decision Tree Regression
- KNN (K-nearest neighbors)

Simple Linear Regression

Using linear regression to predict continuous values


How to find the best fit.

Model Evaluation approaches

- Train and test on the same dataset
- Train/Test Split

Best approach for most accurate results?

Tran and test on the same data set.
    - High "training accuracy"
    - Low "Out of sample accuracy."

What is training & out-of-sample accuracy?

Training accuracy
    - High training accuracy isn't necessarily a good thing.
    - Result of over-fitting.
        - Over-fit: the model is overly trained to the dataset, which may capture noise and produce a non-generalized model.
Out-of-Sample accuracy
    - It's important that our models have a high, out-of-sample accuracy
    - How can we improve out-of-sample accuracy?


Train/Test Split Evaluation approach
    - Have a set to train and to test. This improves out of sample accuracy.
    - Mutually Exclusive.
    - Highly dependent on which datasets the data is trained and tested.

How to use K-fold cross validation?
    - fold the data set into sections.
    - Train parts of it and test it to the fold.
    - Get the average result. (The accuracy)

Regression accuracy
    - Compare actual values and predicted values.

What is an error of the model?
    - Measure of how far the data is from the fitted regression line.

Mean absolute error
    -  Average error

Mean absolute error
    - Square of the error

Root mean squared error
    - Square root of erorr.

Residual sum of square (relative absolute error)

Relative square error
