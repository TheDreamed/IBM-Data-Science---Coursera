Modeling - Concepts


Modeling Questions
    In what way can the data be visualized to get the answer that is required?
    
    Evaluation
    Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?

Data Modeling 
    Descriptive and Predictive modeling can be used.
    Training set - a historical data used to know the accuracy of the model depending on the outcome.

Understanding the question 
    1. Understand the question at hand
    2. Select an analytic approach or method to solve the problem
    3. Obtain, understand, prepare, and model the data.

Case Study - Modeling 
    Initial decision tree classification model
        - Low accuracy on "Yes" outcome
        - need to search (type 1 error false positive)
