Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Preliminary step in data analysis to:
        - Summarize main characteristics of the data
        - Gain better understanding of the data set.
        - Uncover relationships between variables.
        - Extract important variables.

Descriptive Statistics

    - Describe basic features of data
    - Giving short summaries about the sample and measures of the data

Describe.()

-Summarize statistics. A pandas method.

Value_counts()

- summarize the categorical data.

Scatter Plot
- Each observation represented as a point.
- Scatter plot show the relationship between two variables.
    1. Predictor / independent variables on x-axis.
    2. Target / dependent variables on y-axis.


GroupBy (Grouping Data)

- Can be applied on categorical variables.
- Group data into categories.
- Single or multiple variables.


Pivot()

- One variable displayed along the columns and the other variable displayed along the rows.

Heatmap

- Plot target variable over multiple variables

Correlation

- Measures to what extent different variables are interdependent.

For Example:
Lung Cancer - Smoking
Rain - Umbrella

Correlation doesn't imply causation.

Correlation - Postiive Linear relationship / Negative Linear Relationship

Pearson Correlation
    Measure the strength of the correlation between two features.
        - Correlation coefficient
        - P - Value
    Correlation coefficient
        - Close to +1: Large Positive relationship
        - Close to -1: Large negative relationship
        - Close to 0 : No Relationship
    P-Value
        P-Value < 0.001 Strong certainty in the result
        P-Value < 0.05  Moderate certainty in the result
        P-Value < 0.1 Weak certainty in the result
        P-Value > No Certainty in the result
    Strong correlation:
        Correlation coefficient close to 1 or -1
        P value less than 0.001

Categorical variables

We use the Chi-square Test Association (denoted as x2)
The test is intended to test how likely it is that an observed distribution is due to chance.

Chi-Squared Test for Association
The Chi-square tests a null hypotthesis that the variables are independent.

Used to determine relationship between 2 categorical variables.
It tests for association between 2 variables and tells us how likely
the is association due to chance
The test assumes (null hypothesis) that the variables are independent.
The the model does not fit, then that proves that the variables are dependent.

calculation steps:
- use contigency table for observed values from a dataset.
- on contigency table,  for each cell, (row total * column total)/grand total
- this will create table with expected value
- calculate chi square value: SUM((observed-expected)^2 / expected)
- determine p-value for that chi square value
- if p<0.05, then the variables are not independent (Reject null)
