Model Development
    - A model can be thought of as a mathematical equation used to predict a value given one or more other values.
    - Relating one or more independent variables to dependent variables.
    - The more relevant data you have the more accurate your model is.


Linear regression will refer to one independent variable to make a prediction
Multiple Linear Regression will refer to multiple independent variables to make a prediction

Simple Linear Regression (need to research more)
1. The predictor (independent) variable - x
2. The target (dependent) variable - y
