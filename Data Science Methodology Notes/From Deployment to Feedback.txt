From Deployment to Feedback

Deployment - Are stakeholders familiar with the new tool?

Case Study
    Understanding the result
        Assimilate knowledge for business
            Practical Understanding of the meaning of model results.
            Implications of model results for designing intervention actions.
    Gathering application requirements
        Application requirements
            Automated, near-real-time risk assessments of CHF inpatients.
            Easy to use
            Automated data preparation and scoring
            Up-to-date risk assessment to help cliniciancs target high-risk patients.
    Additional Requirements?
        Training for Clinical staff
        Tracking / Monitoring processes

Feedback - Problem solved? Question answered?

    Once the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work,
    it is deployed and put to the ultimate test

        - Actual real-time use in the field.

Case Study - Assessing model performance

    Define review process
        - To measure results of applying the risk model to the CHF patient population
        - Track patients who received intervention
        - Actual readmission outcomes
        - Measure effectiveness of intervention-
        - Compare readmission rates before and after model implementation.
    Refine model
        - Initial review after the first year of implementation
        - Based on feedback data and knowledge gained
        - Participation in intervention program
        - Possibly incorporate detailed pharmaceutical data originally deferred
        - Other possible refinements as yet known.
    Redeploy
        - Continue modeling, deployment, feedback, and refinement throughout the life of the intervention program.

    Course Summary

        Thinking like a data scientist
            - Forming a concrete business or research Problem
            - Collecting and analyzing data
            - Building a model
            - Understanding the feedback after model deployment
        Learned the importance of:
            - Understanding the Question
            - Picking the most effective analytic approach
        To  Work with the data
            - Determining the data requirements
            - Collecting the appropriate data
            - Understanding the data.
            - Preparing the data for modeling
        To Deriving the answer
            - Evaluating and deploying the modeling
            - Getting feedback on it
            - Using that feedback constructively so as to improve the model
    P.S the stages of this methodology are iterative


Lesson Summary
In this lesson, you have learned:

The importance of stakeholder input.

To consider the scale of deployment.

The importance of incorporating feedback to refine the model.

The refined model must be redeployed.

This process should be repeated as often as necessary.
