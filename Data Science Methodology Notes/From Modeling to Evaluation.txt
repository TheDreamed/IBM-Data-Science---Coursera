Modeling - Concepts


Modeling Questions
    In what way can the data be visualized to get the answer that is required?

    Evaluation
    Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?

Data Modeling
    Descriptive and Predictive modeling can be used.
    Training set - a historical data used to know the accuracy of the model depending on the outcome.

Understanding the question
    1. Understand the question at hand
    2. Select an analytic approach or method to solve the problem
    3. Obtain, understand, prepare, and model the data.

Case Study - Modeling
    Initial decision tree classification model
        - Low accuracy on "Yes" outcome
        - need to search (type 1 error false positive)

Data Science Methodology - Evaluation

    When and how to adjust the model?
        Predictive Model -  used statistical technique to predict future behavior.
        Descriptive model -  to help specify and/or understand what the system is, what it does,
        and how it does it.
        Statistical significance - provide evidence concerning the plausibility of the null hypothesis

    Case Study -  Using the ROC Curve

        Diagnostic tool for classification model evaluation
            - Classification model performance
            - True-Postivie Rate vs False-Positive Rate
            - Optimal model at maximum separation


Lesson Summary - Guidelines for a refresher.
The difference between descriptive and predictive models.

The role of training sets and test sets.

The importance of asking if the question has been answered.

Why diagnostic measures tools are needed.

The purpose of statistical significance tests.

That modeling and evaluation are iterative processes.
